# Get_weather
In this repo, I've used weather map API , and with the api key which I got I created this small web application using express which takes the city name as input and search for the query provided by the client and then provides us the weather data. This happens as the server side sent a GET request to the Weather map using API authentication and then the parsing of data is done on the server side to serve the client the required data. 
To run the code, download the node modules and packages (using npm) which is shown under dependencies in package.json file.
